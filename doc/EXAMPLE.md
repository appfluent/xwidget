# Example

Please see the [example](https://github.com/appfluent/xwidget/tree/main/example) folder of this
package. It contains an XWidget version of Flutter's classic starter app. It only scratches the
surface of XWidget's capabilities.

**Please Note:** The inflaters in the example were generated with Flutter 3.19, which means that if
you're using an older version Flutter, you'll need to regenerate the inflaters using the 
following command:

```shell
$ dart run xwidget_builder:generate --only inflaters 
```

Here are some apps using XWidget:
