# Roadmap

The primary focus right now is documentation, critical bug fixes, more documentation, minor
improvements, and oh, even more documentation. The implementation is already fairly stable, but
lacks test coverage. Once the documentation is complete, we'll bump the minor version and
concentrate on testing.

## 0.0.x Releases (2023)

* Write README and API documentation
* Critical bug fixes
* Minor improvements

## 0.x Releases (2024)

* Write unit, widget, UI, and performance tests
* Critical and major bug fixes
* Refine and add documentation as needed

## 1.0.0 Release (mid 2024)

* Stable release
